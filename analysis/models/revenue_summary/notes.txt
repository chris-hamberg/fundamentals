There are 2 different models used to predict revenue from domestic box office.
The first model is merely an estimation constructed by taking US ticket sales
as a percentage of DBO, called market share of DBO (in terms of US ticket 
sales.) The market share is divided by the average percentage of revenue,
and multiplied by 100 to get the estimated revenue.

The second, and more accurate  model is the linear regression on domestic box 
office versus revenues. rssd is the residual squares standard deviation on the 
regression. From DBO, there is an approximate 98% chance that actual revenue 
will fall within the range of "-(2 rssd)" to "+(2 rssd)", and an approximate 68%
chance that actual revenue will fall within the range of "-rssd" to 
"+rssd". The predicted actual revenue from this model is "revenue".

Revenue predictions between the two models can be compared on columns 
"revenue (Model 1)" and "revenue (Model 2)" in the first table for the purpose
of assessing the accuracy of the models. Model 2 is more accurate than Model 1. 

Model 1 was back tested against the dataset, and produced a resonable estimate.

For Model 2:

The Pearsons Correlation Coefficient is: 0.9878795895767283

The Coefficient of Determination, r**2 = 0.9759060835022852
That is, 98% of the linear relationship (DBO -> revenue,) explains revenue.

The residual squares standard deviation rho about the least-squares line is
74,878,802.26825552 (times 4 to adjust to yearly) compared to the sample 
standard deviation of 471,794,214.5167205 (times 4 to adjust to yearly.) 
Proportional to mean revenue the residual error is 0.0758435960125316. Normality 
test p-value = 3.269664005259733 * 10^(-5)

Thus, we can expect that the predictive power of Model 2 must be extremely 
reliable.

Next we shall infer from this revenue prediction, a prediction on earnings, and 
then compare that prediction with a prediction on earnings directly from DBO.
