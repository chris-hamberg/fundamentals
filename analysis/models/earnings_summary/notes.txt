There are 2 different models used to predict earnings from domestic box offic.
The first model first predicts revenue, and from revenue predicts earnings.
The second model predicts earnings directly from DBO. All predictions are 
constructed by linear regression.

The second model is slightly more accurate. So we predict directly from DBO. 
rssd is the residual squares standard deviation on the regression. From DBO 
there is an approximate 98% chance that the actual earnings will fall within the 
range of "-(2 rssd)" to "+(2 rssd)", and an approximate 68% chance that the 
actual earnings will fall within the range of "-rssd" to "+rssd". The predicted 
actual earnings from this model is "earnings".

Earnings predictions between the two models can be compared on columns
"earnings (Model 1)" and "earnings (Model 2)" in the first table for the purpose
of assessing accuracy of the models. Model 2 is more accurate than Model 1.

For Model 1:

First, Model 1 uses a linear regression on DBO to revenue, to predict revenue.
This sub-model is extremely accurate. The Pearsons Correlation Coefficient is: 
0.9878795895767283, and the Coefficient of Determination, 
r**2 = 0.9759060835022852. That is, 98% of the linear relationship (
DBO -> revenue,) explains revenue. From predicted revenue, earnings is 
predicted. For revenue to earnings Pearsons Correlation Coefficient is: 
0.8997017164327481, and the Coefficient of Determination, 
r**2 = 0.8094631785520329. That is, 81% of the linear relationship 
(revenue -> earnings,) can explain earnings

Again, Model 2, predicting earnings from DBO, is more accurate, so Model 2 is 
the model that we ultimately use. The Pearsons Correlation Coefficient is: 
0.9066831913698025, and the Coefficient of Determination, 
r**2 = 0.8220744095125301. That is, 82% of the linear relationship 
(DBO -> profits,) can explain earnings.

The residual standard deviation rho about the least-squares line for Model 2 is
111,259,102.882163 (x4, to convert to yearly) compared to the sample standard 
deviation 259,856,663.12245965 (x4 to convert to yearly.) Normality test 
pvalue = 9.25190417852916 * 10^(-9)

This model has very strong predictive power.
