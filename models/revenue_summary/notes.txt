There are 2 different models used to predict revenue from domestic box office.
The first model is merely an estimation constructed by taking US ticket sales
as a percentage of DBO, called market share of DBO (in terms of US ticket 
sales.) The market share is divided by the average percentage of revenue,
and multiplied by 100 to get the estimated revenue.

The second model is the linear regression on domestic box office versus 
revenues. rsd is the residual squares standard deviation on the regression.
From DBO, there is an approximate 98% chance that actual revenue will fall 
within the range of "rev -(2rsd)" to "rev +(2rsd)", and an approximate 68%
chance that actual revenue will fall within the range of "rev -rsd" to 
"rev +rsd". The predicted actual revenue from this model is rev.

Revenue predictions between the two models can be compared on columns 
"revenue (Model 1)" and "(Model 2)" to assess the accuracy of the models. 
Model 2 is more accurate than Model 1. 

Model 1 was back tested against the data, and produced a resonable estimate.

For Model 2:

The Pearsons Correlation Coefficient is: 0.9878795895767283

The Coefficient of Determination, r**2 = 0.9759060835022852
That is, 98% of the linear relationship (DBO -> revenue,) explains revenue.

The residual standard deviation rho about the least-squares line is
74,878,802.26825552 compared to the sample standard deviation of
471,794,214.5167205. Proportional to mean revenue the residual error is
0.0758435960125316. Normality test p-value = 3.269664005259733 * 10^(-5)

Thus, we can expect that the predictive power of Model 2 is extremely reliable.

Next we shall infer from this revenue prediction, a prediction on earnings, and 
then compare that prediction with a prediction on earnings directly from DBO.
