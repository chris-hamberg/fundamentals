Pearsons Correlation Coefficient: 0.8997017164327481

The Coefficient of Determination, r**2 = 0.8094631785520329
That is, 81% of the linear relationship (revenue -> earnings,) explains 
earnings.

The residual standard deviation rho about the least-squares line is 
128,006,839.0372937 compared to the sample standard deviation of 
286,511,476.22373724

According to this model AMC would require approximately $5,643,476,220 in yearly 
revenue phi to be net profitable. phi determines earnings. phi at $5,643,476,220
implies an approximate 68% chance earnings will be approximately 0 +/- rho, and 
an approximate 98% chance earnings will be approximately 0 +/- 2rho.
