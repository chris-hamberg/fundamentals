The amount of revenue AMC gets from US ticket sales is the market share for AMC
of the domestic box office, in terms of US ticket sales.

We find market share as a percentage for each year, and then the average of 
percentage market share for all years since 2017.

Moreover, US ticket sales consist of so much of AMC yearly revenue. We find
the percentage of revenue that was from US ticket sales for each year. Then, 
we average the percentage of revenue.

Market share of DBO per the percentage of revenue is equal to the total
revenue divided by one hundred percent. We want to predict total revenue, so
we solve for that by cross multiplication. Meanings that, The market share 
divided percentage of revenue times one hundred is equal to total revenue as
an estimate, following from domestic box office.

Note that this is just a primative model to estimate revenue from DBO such that
it can be possible to cross validate the linear regression model.
